And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go
I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (oh, oh)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah, yeah)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better, better, better)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(But doin' this is all that I've known ever, ever, ever)
I let the good ones go
