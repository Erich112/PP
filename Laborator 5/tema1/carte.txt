Sleepwalker
Ava Max

You say you want a taste, then bottle me up
But I should warn you, once is never enough (ah, ah)
Zero to 60 from the second we touch
You say you're fallin' in love
You just might get what you want
So you better think carefully
I'll have you up seven moons with me
I'll turn you to a
Sleepwalker
Dream of me wherever you go
If I take you home, I'll turn you to a
Sleepwalker
Eyes are burnin' open or closed
Thought you should know, oh
I'm an obsession, not just a game
It feels like inception, stuck in your brain, oh
Sleepwalker
Dream of me wherever you go
Remember, I told you so
So call me karma for the hearts that you broke
What goes around comes back to kick down your door (ah, ah)
I'll have you screamin' from the murder she wrote
Before you hit the pillow
You just might get what you want
So you better think carefully
I'll have you up seven moons with me
I'll turn you to a
Sleepwalker
Dream of me wherever you go
If I take you home, I'll turn you to a
Sleepwalker
Eyes are burnin' open or closed
Thought you should know, oh
I'm an obsession, not just a game
It feels like inception, stuck in your brain, oh
Sleepwalker
Dream of me wherever you go
Remember, I told you so
I'll turn you to a (yeah)
Sleepwalker
Dream of me wherever you go
If I take you home, I'll turn you to a
Sleepwalker
Eyes are burnin' open or closed
Thought you should know, oh
I'm an obsession, not just a game
It feels like inception, stuck in your brain, oh
Sleepwalker
Dream of me wherever you go
Remember, I told you so
