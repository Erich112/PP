</h2><h1>Ava Max

<br>You say you want a taste, then bottle me up
<br>But I should warn you, once is never enough (ah, ah)
<br>Zero to 60 from the second we touch
<br>You say you're fallin' in love
<br>You just might get what you want
<br>So you better think carefully
<br>I'll have you up seven moons with me
<br>I'll turn you to a
<br>Sleepwalker
<br>Dream of me wherever you go
<br>If I take you home, I'll turn you to a
<br>Sleepwalker
<br>Eyes are burnin' open or closed
<br>Thought you should know, oh
<br>I'm an obsession, not just a game
<br>It feels like inception, stuck in your brain, oh
<br>Sleepwalker
<br>Dream of me wherever you go
<br>Remember, I told you so
<br>So call me karma for the hearts that you broke
<br>What goes around comes back to kick down your door (ah, ah)
<br>I'll have you screamin' from the murder she wrote
<br>Before you hit the pillow
<br>You just might get what you want
<br>So you better think carefully
<br>I'll have you up seven moons with me
<br>I'll turn you to a
<br>Sleepwalker
<br>Dream of me wherever you go
<br>If I take you home, I'll turn you to a
<br>Sleepwalker
<br>Eyes are burnin' open or closed
<br>Thought you should know, oh
<br>I'm an obsession, not just a game
<br>It feels like inception, stuck in your brain, oh
<br>Sleepwalker
<br>Dream of me wherever you go
<br>Remember, I told you so
<br>I'll turn you to a (yeah)
<br>Sleepwalker
<br>Dream of me wherever you go
